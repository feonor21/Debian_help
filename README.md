like any developer, install 25000 VM, reinstall, reconfigure...
it's long :( so I prefer to make a script that will do 25000 times the same actions with 25000 times the same reliability.


install_system.sh allows to install my debian setup faster
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/feonor21/Debian_help/master/install_system.sh)"
